Movie Recommendation System
Overview
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using Python and scikit-learn. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to suggest movies based on features like genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director. The system handles fuzzy matching for user input and is designed for easy integration into apps or web services.
