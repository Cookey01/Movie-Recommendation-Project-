 # Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using Python and scikit-learn. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to suggest movies based on features like genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director. The system handles fuzzy matching for user input and is designed for easy integration into apps or web services.

## Features
- Data preprocessing with text cleaning and feature combination.
- Weighted feature engineering for improved accuracy.
- TF-IDF with optimized parameters (stop words, n-grams, etc.).
- Cosine similarity for recommendation generation.
- Example usage: Recommendations for movies like "The Dark Knight".
